_Hey! I've created this camping script. You can craft a tent, and fill it with materials like TheForest style. Also a Campfire, and a bed._
_Its pretty optimized (0.038ms on profiler view). If you want to add new stuff, you are free to do it, you can even do a PR. :)_
 
## SHOWCASE

### WHAT YOU CAN DO📋
- You can craft a "skeleton tent", and you will need some materials in order to craft a real Tent. (configurable)
- You can craft a Campfire, turn it on and off.
- You can open and close your Tent.
- You can craft a Bed and sleep on it.

### WORK TO-DO📋
- Make the tent stay after server restart. (SQL needed)
- Add more furniture, like a piece of wood where you can attach your horse.
- Let you cook in the campfire, and upgrade it.
- Tell me more ideas! :3
 
Add this to your server.cfg
You will need **redemrp_notification**, you can replace it if you want!
```
ensure bc_camping
ensure redemrp_notification
```
